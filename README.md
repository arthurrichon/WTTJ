# Couldn't do / Would like to :
* Make the custom play button on Videos pay the youtube video in fullscreen mode
* Smoother animations in general
* Randomized grid content / Ordering / Filtering
* Custom Progress Bar (Lack of time)
* A way to have a grid layout for desktop AND mobile (Currently forcing a mobile layout in css)
